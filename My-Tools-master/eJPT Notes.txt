			ACK (Seq A+2, Ack B+1
			
	UDP - Non guarenteed
			Connectionless. 
			Better throughput

	Netstat for current TCP connections. 
	
	IDS - Check Payload
		NIDS - Network Intrustion Detection Systems (Typically on Router)
		HIDS - Host Intrustion Detection Systems (Application logs,file-system etc)
		
	IPS - Intrusion Prevention Systems
		Drop malicious requests. 
	
	NAT - reqrites souce IP typcially on Internet connections. Computer must use it as the default gateway. 
	
	DNS
	Convert Name to IP Addresses
		- Top Level Domain - TLD
		- Domain 
		- Sub Domain
		- Host name
	Reverse DNS - Ip to Name (If Admin configured)

4. Penetration Testing
	Lifecycle
		Find any and every vulnerability with least impact on production systems and servers.

	4.1 Engagement
		Establish
			- Type (Black, Grey Box)
			- Time consuming
			- Complexity of apps/services in scope
			- Targets
			Best to establish a sound and targeted proposal
			Keep in mind the clients needs and infrastructure
			Should include
				- Clients needs. Your understanding of what's required. 
				- The approach and methodology you'd like to use. Automated/manual scanning tools, testing, onsite etc. 
				- Value analysis. Risks/Benefits
				- Price and time estimate. 
				- Penetration test or vulnerability assessment. Remote or onsite. etc. 
				- Scope of the engagement. IP Addresses, network blocks, domain names. 
			Legal Work - As a freelance. Different if work for an IT Services company. 
				NDA
					What can/can't do. 
				Insurance 
				Lawyers
				Responsibility to keep information private and encrypted. 
				Rules of Engagement
					Scope of the engagement, time window, contacts. 
		Information Gathering
			General Information	(Names and email addresses) Good for social engineering. 
				Board of Directors
				Investors
				Managers and Employees
				Branch location and addresses. 
			Infrastructure Information Gathering
				Transform IP/domain details into servers and Operating Systems
				WHOIS and DNS Information. 
				Give meaning to every IP address in scope
					Live/Not
					Websites or other services
						Harvest
							Domains
							Subdomains
							Pages
							Technologies (PHP, Java, .NET)
							Frameworks(Drupal, Joomla, Wordpress)
						Treat web applications as seperate enteties. 
					What OS
						No need to target Windows vulnerabilities on Linux hosts. 
					Helps 
						Focus efforts
						Target attacks
						Sharpen tools for exploitation phase
		Footprinting and Scanning. 
			Port scanning
				nmap
			Detecting services
				nmap
				Find OS, purpose of the IP address. importance of the host. 
		Vulnerability Assessment
			Building a list of the vulnerablities present
			Assessment of each target identified previously. 
			Manually or via Automated tools. 
			Automated important to configure based on previous steps. 
			Automated tools can help carry out a penetration test, but they will not perform a penetration test on their own. 
		Exploitation
			Checks and validates a vulnerability
				Also widens and increases the privilages on the target systems and networks. 
			Sucessfull exploitation expands the target network. 
			Repeat theprocess from the information gathering phase
			Ends when there are no more systems and services in-scope to exploit. 
			Find any and all vulnerabilities. 
		Reporting
			Penetration test report. 
			Official way to deliver results to:
				Execs. 
				IT Staff
				Development Team
			Shows and explains the result of the tests and is the actual deliverabile of the engagement. 
			Must contain. 
				Techniques used. 
				Vulnerabilities found
				Exploits used. 
				Impact and risk analysis for each vulnerability
				Remediation tips. 
			Real value for the client
			Provides useful suggestions and techniques. Very important. 
		Consultancy
			Penetration testsers asked to provide some hours of consultancy after delivering the report. 
			Additional service. 
		Keep all engagement details in an encrypted and safe place or destroy it. 
		
		Secret of a sucessful test - Picture the systems in scope as a target. 
			Information gathering and fingerprinting widens the target. 
			Also called Widening the attack surface. 
			Targeted attacks are less likely to trigger an alarm in the victims defense system.
